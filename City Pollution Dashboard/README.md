# 🌫️ Air Quality vs Respiratory Health Analysis 📊🫁  
**Data Analytics Project using Power BI**

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

A comprehensive data-driven project focused on **understanding the impact of worsening air quality on respiratory health** across metropolitan cities. Leveraging **Power BI** for advanced visual analytics, this project bridges environmental data with public health insights—empowering policymakers with actionable intelligence.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

A governmental public health and environmental regulatory agency has initiated an in-depth investigation to evaluate the **consequences of poor air quality** on urban populations, particularly the **rise in respiratory illnesses** such as:

- **Asthma**
- **Bronchitis**
- **Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)**
- **Lung infections**

---

## 🔬 Objective

To build a **data-driven, interactive dashboard** using Power BI that analyzes and visualizes the relationship between:

- **Air pollutant levels** (PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, SO₂, CO, VOCs)
- **Respiratory-related hospitalizations & outpatient visits**
- **Meteorological conditions, traffic, industry, and urbanization patterns**

---

## 📌 Key Goals

- 📍 Identify **pollution hotspots** across cities
- 📈 Track **temporal trends** in pollution and health data
- 🏥 Discover correlations between **pollutants** and **illness frequency**
- 🔮 Develop predictive insights to **forecast high-risk periods**
- 🧩 Suggest **policy, infrastructure, and awareness interventions**

## 💡 Research Questions

1. 🏙️ Which cities exhibit the most severe pollution levels? How have they evolved over time?
2. 📊 What is the correlation between pollutant concentrations and hospitalization rates?
3. 🔮 Can we forecast pollution-induced health crises before they occur?
4. 🛠️ What **regulatory actions**, **urban planning strategies**, or **awareness campaigns** can reduce health risks?
